IV. INSTALLATION/COMPILATION
  Look/modify the appropriate makefile, or create a project with all the 
.c files in it. pl_conf.h and pl_defs.h have some defines that should be
editted for your platform.
  
V. NOTES
  For some platforms (i.e. DOS), in your startup code you *must* disable 
floating point exceptions for some parts of Plush (i.e. perspective correction)
to work right. You can do this using

#include <float.h>
_control87(MCW_EM,MCW_EM);

VI. LIBRARY INFORMATION
  Well, this library is neither fast nor well documented, but it is a good 
example of decent api design and overall engine implementation. Hope it brings
joy to peoples' hearts.


VII. DOCUMENTATION/MORE INFORMATION
  At the time of this release, API documentation is minimal. I am currently 
working on elaborate HTML docs, which are about 10% done. The file PL_API.html
included with this archive contains it. There is also a decent amount
of documentation in plush.h and pl_*.h. Check back to 
http://nullsoft.com periodically to see if new documentation has
been released (update 9/14/00- this will never happen).
  Also, as you might have noticed, no examples have been included with this 
release. Please see http://nullsoft.com for examples.
