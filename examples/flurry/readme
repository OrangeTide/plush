Okay, here's a better demo app that uses allegro.

I am beginning to find that the way I am using allegro to blit to screen
is a touch slow. So if you want it to be faster, write your own VGA
or VESA code. 

To prove my point, there is flurry2.c which doesn't use allegro, but instead
uses some quick and dirty code to write directly to screen using mode13... 
It's a little bit faster. Also, the executable is *definately* a little bit 
smaller.

I'm not dissing Allegro. In fact, Allegro is really damn cool, but I also want
to show that Plush is really independent of any graphics library. Anyways,
one more thing:

It can be debated whether chaos is good, but chaos is undeniably cool.
