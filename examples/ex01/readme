These are some simple examples for Plush 1.1. They will compile in linux 
(with svgalib) using makefile.lin, Or DOS/djgpp using makefile.dj, and, if 
you're really daring, using Watcom (I have not provided a watcom makefile).

These are the first 4 (of lots) of examples for Plush.

Enjoy, and send all comments and suggestions, as well as new examples to:
